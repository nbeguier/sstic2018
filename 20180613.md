### Closed, heterogenous platforms and the (defensive) reverse engineers dilemma
**Halvar Flake**, *60 min*

He spent 13 years working on Reverse Engineering and 7 years reading papers about RE.

A lot of tools and framework, but generally nothing work in real-life scenario. 

On Windows, the privilege process is hard to debug, find code coverage is difficult too.
On mobile, this is a closed platform. On iOS, there is a lack of debugging tools and you have to jailbreak the phone : ridiculous.

Generally, choices are made to sacrifice the debug to prevent security. It's misguided because attacks still continue, but the defenders have to pay the tax over and over again. 

The internet giant have a profit by engineer very high :
  - Google : 1.3m$
  - Apple : 1.85m$
  - Facebook : 1.62m$

No competition possible ! The RE tool market is restrained (between 20m$ and 100m$, approx. 2-60 engineer in the world)

RE community is external and cultural. RE are not good in development... generally. It's hard to find an expert in RE and good in development.
Doing python script and throw them away after is a bad practice. Long term speaking, they should me reusable. Get the job done vs invest in the future.

Too many framworks (IDA/HexRays, BAP, PaiMei, ..., Radare, etc...)

Sometime, tools are written for a paper/presentation

No RE distribution

Linux : Debian, Rehat, kali
LaTeX : MikTeX..
Datascience : Anaconda

-----

5 ideas to make things better :

  - Stop undebuggable platform for defenders. Security gain is not true.
  - Clean interface abstraction layers for RE tools. Cannot agree on one tool, work together to improve the existing instead of create new framework.
  - A distribution for a full RE stack. Download a set of packages that just work.
  - Focus by toolmakers. Make things you can reproduce and reuse.
  - Randomized real-world test-cases for tools.


```
SMT solver ?
(faire une doc sur radare à l'occasion)
(BAP, angr)

whats is VSA ?

BinDiff ?

zynamics ? (raised VC at one point)

### Subverting your server through its BMC: the HPE iLO4 case
**Alexandre Gazet, Fabien Perigaud,Joffrey Czarny**, *30 min*

The iLO is present on every HP hardware, it's a chipset.
Autonomous and independent. ARM. Has is own RAM, Network card, etc.
It boots when the server is alimented in energy.

In the specs, we can see that it can access to the host memory.

Sometimes, iLO are reachable from the owl company or even from the internet !


Some exploits exists to have a rootkit on the host from the iLO : https://github.com/airbus-seclab/ilo4_toolbox

curl -H "Connection: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" disable authentication !!! AHAH

Patch from 2.53 (buggy), 2.54 on iLO 

Conclusion :

  - Patch regularly
  - Put iLo in a dedicated VLAN
  - Disable in unused


### T-Brop: Taint-Based Return Oriented Programming
**Colas Le Guernic, Francois KHOURBIGA**, *30 min*

Presentation of a new ROP tool, which is a PoC.

Tips : Enable ASLR would be a good start


Looking for a gadget :

Syntactic approach: 
- List gadget
- RP++ (fast)

Symbolic approach
- Compute symbolic I/O relation
- angrop (slow)

T-BROP is a good compromise


### Certificate Transparency ou comment un nouveau standard peut aider votre veille sur certaines menaces
**Christophe Brocas, Thomas Damonneville**, *15 min*

A hack of a CA could lead to the generation of malicious certificates.
False sentiment of security. No possibility of detection.


**In 2013, a Google Initiative** : Obligation of a CA to consign every certificate in logs (integer and verifiable) open to consultation.

We could see every certificate emission. The browser will make an active check (Chrome 69 will block a website if it provides no CT when its certificates is issued after the 30/04/2018)

We could immediately monitor malicious record.

Conclusion :

  - Narrowed vision (but better than before)
  - Efficient
  - Low cost


### Risques associés aux signaux parasites compromettants : le cas des câbles DVI et HDMI
**Emmanuel Duponchelle, Pierre-Michel Ricordel**, *30 min*

The demo of "Tempest SDR" software, with a receiving antenna (periodic log, 400MHz-1GHz), an amplifier and a software defined radio.

It's hard to know the armouring of a physical cable.
Measuring the inensity of the radiation.

A good cable generally comes from a big manufacturer. Nothing to do with price.


How to protect ?

This kind of attack comes from when there is no visual, auditive and logical access. In a secured area. 
VGA is not bad, because few radiation. HDMi and DVi are the worst.
Display Port is the future because of the scrambled signal, which is not reproducible.





### Smart TVs: Security of DVB-T
**Chaouki Kasmi, José Lopes Esteves, Tristan Claverie**, *30 min*

Is that to put have connected TV ?

Some file can be put via the Carousel. Being root via DVB-T signal without disturbing the user and offline is also possible.

Ad a counter-attack, DVB implement a signature system to secure the flow.

Except... that's optional.

The RFC is also badly written and full of exploit.

Responsibilities :

  - DVB & HbbTV should inform developers
  - Developers should inform users
  - Users should be able to change their level of security


### Three vulns, one plug
**Gwenn FEUNTEUN, Olivier Dubasque, Yves Duchesne**, *15 min*

Reverse Engineering of a Smart Plug controllable via Smartphone and Wifi.

And fix of some severe vulnerabilities.


### Escape Room pour la sécurité
**Eric Alata, Erwan Beguin, Vincent Nicomette**, *15 min*

Attack and Defensive mode.



### Du PCB à l'exploit: étude de cas d'une serrure connectée Bluetooth Low Energy
**Damien Cauquil**, *30 min*

This is a methodology to RE IoT

State of the art :

  - OWASP IoT
    - Still in redaction
    - Few documentation

  - Rapid7
    - 8 meaningful step
    - No info on the implementation

6 steps are :

1. **Analyse fonctionnelle** de l’équipement à tester
2. Recherche de **vulnérabilités matérielles**
3. **Rétro-ingénierie** de circuits imprimés
4. **Collecte et désassemblage** des micro-logiciels
5. Recherche de **vulnérabilités logicielles**
6. Analyse des **communications**
